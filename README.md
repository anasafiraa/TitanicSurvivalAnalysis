# TitanicSurvivalAnalysis

## Overview
The TitanicSurvivalAnalysis project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, and class. By applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple machine learning models, this project aims to uncover patterns and build predictive models with strong accuracy.

## Key Objectives:
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key factors affecting survival.
2. Build various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN) to predict survival.
3. Compare model performances using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## Tools and Technologies:
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Jupyter Notebook
